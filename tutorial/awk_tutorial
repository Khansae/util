#print the quote sign
awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote <'"'"'>" }' #this is concat of three strings '...' "'" '...'
awk 'BEGIN { print "Here is a single quote <'\''>" }'

#some simple examples:
#longest line in data file
awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) }
     END { print max }' data

# Print every line that has at least one field
awk 'NF > 0' data

#you can have multiple rules in awk (first goes first rule, then second, if line contains both patterns then will
#be processed two times)

awk '/12/ { print $0 }
     /21/ { print $0 }' data

env variables:
